# Python Files

Last time, we ran all of Python commands from the `>>>` prompt.
Interactive commands are good for experimentation, but we also want to save our work in files.

1. Run `IDLE` from the Start Menu.
1. Click on `File > New Window` in the menu.

You now have a window called "Untitled". It's empty, so let's type some code.

```python
import turtle

turtle.forward(200)
turtle.right(90)
turtle.forward(200)
turtle.right(90)
turtle.forward(200)
turtle.right(90)
turtle.forward(200)
turtle.right(90)
```

Writing our commands into a file let's us save our work,
and we can run all of these commands at once.

*Click on `Run > Run Module` to run this program.*
